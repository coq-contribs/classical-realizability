Title: Krivine's classical realizability
Description: The aim of this Coq library is to provide a framework for checking
proofs in Krivine's classical realizability for second-order Peano arithmetic.

It is designed ot be as extensible as the original theory by Krivine and
supports on-the-fly extensions by new instructions with their evaluation 
rules.
Keywords: classical realizability, Krivine's realizability, primitive datatype, 
non determinism, quote, axiom of countable choice, real numbers
